	<li> <h3> What is CustomCo.com? </h3>

CustomCo.com is a leading online retailer of products that inform, educate, and inspire. The CustomCo group also has stores in the Canada, Germany, France, Japan and United Kingdom. Because we exist "virtually" on the Web, we have unlimited shelf space and can offer a selection of over 17 million titles including over 13 million Book titles and over 1 million music titles. Compare that to a typical physical-world book superstore, which carries around 170,000 books, or a typical physical-world music superstore, which carries around 34,000 CDs. </li>

	<li> <h3> Why do I encounter various availability listings on your site?</h3>

Titles have different availabilities simply due to their demand, proximity, and availability to CustomCo.com. We also source our products from various distributors. The availability on products we obtain from distributors may vary according to whether the distributor has the product in stock or not.

If a title is listed as out of stock or unavailable, it means that it is not currently available to CustomCo.com or not in stock through our distribution channels. However, you may still be able to sell out of stock items through our Marketplace feature. </li>

	<li> <h3> How can I make it easier for customers to find my product? </h3>

You can ensure that your product listing has complete and correct title, author/artist/actor, and subject information. This information helps customers easily find items they will want to purchase in our store.

In addition, we offer our customers numerous tools to aid them in their hunt. </li>
